-->for insert into fd statements....... add a unique constarint in fd table to avoid repeated inserts of fds... + sort the attrs while inserting....

Then to that create a table to store the fd lhs rhs values kindof like a view. + it has unique / check constraints.

except that if the table already had data before.... we need to fill the newly created table with that data too.
so kind of this is the workflow.



<insert into fd> ==========transform======>   <insert into fd table><create rel fd table><insert select fd attrs (*) from table into rel fd table.>



-->insert into a speciifc table values ().


<First need to kindof loop through all fds of that table.. then 
insert the present tuple's fd view attrs into rel fd tables.... if some constraint fails, triggers error!
if all right then insert into the specific table.

HOW TO DO LOOPING??? implicitly by queries.


handle both kind of inserts into fd tbale.

nsert into player_scores (player_number, round_scores)
values (10001, ARRAY [95, 92, 96, 97, 98] );


insert into player_scores (player_number, round_scores)
values (10002, '{91, 92, 93, 95, 99}' );
